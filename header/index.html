				The jump is a three-stage process. First, the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg (tibia)
				against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle. Second, there is a
				period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but
				the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor
				muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specialisations in the
				joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully
				flexed. Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle
				shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The
				extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high
				force (up to 14 N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third
				stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the
				flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the
				elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff
				cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the
				store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high
				power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.
